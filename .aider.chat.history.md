A stylized logo featuring a rocket-shaped coin with a notification bell symbol overlay, symbolizing airdrop alerts. The design uses vibrant gradient colors (blue to purple) against a light background, with subtle sparkles to convey excitement and opportunity. The logo should be clear, modern, and easily recognizable, suitable for a crypto airdrop alert app.
